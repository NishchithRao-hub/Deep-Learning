# Deep-Learning
Used Libraries : Matplot lib, TensorFlow and Pandas
1.) Used Churn Modelling dataset which is also attached.
2.) Performed Data Pre Processing and by also performing one hot encoding to label the categorical data.
3.) Created a two hidden layer artificial neural network(ANN) using sigmoid as the activation function.
4.) Performed train test split and fit the data to our ANN. 
5.) Trained our ANN with adam optimizer, batch size=32 and trained for 100 epochs.
6.) Performed evaluation by predicting whether a new bank customer with our own provided details will stay or leave ?
7.) The ANN acheived a performance of 86.15 % to successfully predict the action of a bank customer.

THANK YOU.
